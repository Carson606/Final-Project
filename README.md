# Abstract
After our combined analysis of the different aspects of neighborhoods in Pittsburgh when looking at employment and income, household type, and firearm seizure data, we were able to determine which neighborhood in Pittsburg is best for a burglars. 
By graphing and looking at the data provided by the WPRDC, we were able to determine that the best neighborhood for a theif to live in would be North Shore, a neighborhood just north of downtown Pittsburg. This neighborhood has one of the highest education and income levels, one of the highest percentage of alone living situations, and one of the lowest amount of gun seizures, making it a great place to be a thief. Being able to keep weapons safe, avoiding the prying eyes of police, and being able to rob easy and wealthy targets makes this neighborhood a thief's dream.
